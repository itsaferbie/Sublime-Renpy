Indent doesn't work properly for "python:", as it's in the
source.python context, rather than the source.renpy context.

- ground inside imagemaps isn't orange like xpos and stuff
- the "# The two window variant." comment in say screen has window variant in pink
- Comments are the same color as all text apart from keywords, I think it's nice if comments have different colors though(Maybe just because I'm used to it since the other editors I use have it like this and it was like this before?)
- Strings are white just as everything else(they were dark yellow before I think?)
- I believe numbers had a different color before?
- If/else/for are white
- input(eg in input screen) is white
- init/style aren't working properly(see image)
