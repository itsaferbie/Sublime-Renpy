Sublime Renpy v1.0.2
======================

This update adds support for auto-indentation of lines ending with colons.
Previously, only Python-specific statements were recognized, such as if statements.
Rather than adding keywords, Sublime Renpy now overrides this behavior for
any line ending with a colon. This was done with ATL syntax and menu choices in mind.

Also, the autocompletion for menu was changed to use quotation marks instead
of apostrophes. This is because apostrophes are far more likely to appear
within a menu choice, so not having to escape them makes more sense.
