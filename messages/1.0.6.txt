Sublime Renpy v1.0.6
======================

This update adds two hotkey overrides when working with
a file in RenpyLanguage.
Specifically, ctrl+b, ctrl+i and ctrl+u have been overridden
to provide word processor-like functionality rather than
the default Sublime Text behavior.

For example, if you're writing the script for a Renpy game,
and you want to italicize a word, you can now highlight it
and hit ctrl+i.
Similarly, highlighting a word and hitting ctrl+b will make
it bold, and ctrl+u will underline it.

This behavior was modified because italic and bold text is
very common, whereas the commands Sublime Text has mapped
to those combinations would likely be used far less when
making a Renpy game.
