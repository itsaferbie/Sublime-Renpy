Sublime Renpy v1.0.3
======================

This update makes any document using RenpyLanguage
use spaces instead of tabs. ie. Hitting the tab key
will now enter a certain number of spaces (usually 4)
instead.

As you probably already know, this is because Renpy
doesn't allow tabs within rpy documents.
